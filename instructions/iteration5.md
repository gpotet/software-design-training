# Iteration 5: purchase

Sales are growing, it's great. Customers are now asking for their purchase invoices.
In this iteration we will build an invoicing system to keep track of purchases.

Implement `index` and `create` endpoints in the [PurchasesController](../app/controllers/purchases_controller.rb), creating and listing user invoices.

Each invoice has only one product.

Unskip tests from [iteration_5_test.rb](../test/controllers/iteration_5_test.rb) and fix what is needed.
